          <p class="p-questions"> * Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</p>
       
          <p class="answer">there are 10 principal of neuroplasticity: 1-use it or lose it 2- use it and improve it  3- specificity   
            4- Repetition Matters  5- Intensity Matters 6- Time Matters 7- Salience Matters  8- Age Matters  9- Transference or Generalization
            10- Interference: When patients are actually able to come in for neurological treatment and that treatment is delayed, 
            they often come in with compensatory behaviors for skill deficits, having already learned a different way of compensating,
             but which may not be the best way. With this, some of the challenge to learning the best way to regain a skill may involve
              "unlearning" some of these previously acquired behaviors. 
          </p>
      
          <p class="p-questions"> * Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</p>
         
          <p class="answer"> I think the first 2 are more important in learning a new skill. The first 2 are:
            "Use it or lose it" and "Use it and improve it". With more and more practice and research, the ability of the brain can be increased
            Then you can create different skills 
          </p>
     
          <p class="p-questions"> * What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</p>

          <p class="answer">practicing every day more and more, researching and finding more information on topics
             to better underestand and  build skills. 
            also, by improving my listening ability. i can improve the skills to have an efficient communicatin at workgit </p>
